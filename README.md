# PortfolioProject on Covid deaths record.
This is an analysis on Covid deaths using SQL sever  
I used SQL to analyse the realtionships between several records represented as columns of data like;
Country,continent, population, tests, vaccination and deaths, and non vaccinated.

My analysis worked on;
1. Percentage of deaths in reltion to the population.
2. Ratio of countries  wtih high positive tests and population vaccinated.
3. Sum of countries population vaccinated.

From this analysis, i see the each countries with affected population and their recovery through vaccination with respect to time.

Also i saw a relationship between continents and how the ratio to which they were affected.
